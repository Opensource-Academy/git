# Git 101 - Introduction to Git

## Description
> "Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people." - Wikipedia

Git is used to collaborate on (software) projects. Git is an somewhat complicated tool, this document serves as a list of Git functionality that you must understand to be able to fully follow to get working with Git.

## Installation
On MacOS: MacOS comes with Git already installed.  
On Debian based Linux: Most distros come with Git already installed. Otherwise install it with [Apt](apt):
```
sudo apt install git
```

## Configuration
### SSH
Linux uses will probably need go through [some SSH configuration](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) after they installed Git .

### Aliases
How to set up [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)

## Usage
### Basics
#### What is Git?
Git is a rather complicated computer program used for version control and collaborating on (software) projects. Git has a lot of features and options and whilst you are just getting started, you will only use a portion of what is available.

Git works with so called repositories (or repos): on your local machine a repo is simply a directory. You can use the Git program to keep track of changes made to this directory. By creating a 'commit', you basically create a snapshot of the status of the directory. 

However, Git goes much deeper. Follow this simple [tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) to understand the basics of what Git can do. 

> Ensure you understand how to commit and manage branches.

If you are more of a visual learner, you could also try to follow [this interactive tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

#### Git, Github and Gitlab
Understand that Git is the tool that is described on this page and that Github and Gitlab are both repository hosting services.

#### Basic actions
This is a very short list of extremely basic commands to use Git. If you need more, follow the [tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or use this [cheat sheet](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

##### How to get a repo
Clone one from github/gitlab/somewhere else.
```
git clone <git url>
```
Turn a local directory into a local repository.
```
git init
```
Connect a local repo to a remote repo.
```
git remote add origin <git url>
```

##### Simple repo commands
See the status of all files in the Git repo.
```
git status
```
Add files to the staging area.
```
git add <file(s)>
```
Delete files and no longer track them with Git.
```
git rm <files>
```
Add a commit.
```
git commit -m  "<commit message>"
```
In case you removed a file with *rm* instead of *git rm* you can use *-a* with your commit to automatically stop tracking removed files.
```
git commit -am "<commit message>"
```

##### Advanced repo commands
Show the currently configured remote repository for your repo.
```
git remote -v
```
Add an upstream repo (to pull from the repo your fork was based on).
```
git remote add upstream <git url to repo your forked from>
```
Pull the latest version from upstream.
```
git pull upstream master
```
Push changes you made to remote (Gitlab).
```
git push origin <branch name>
```

##### Branches
Get a list of available branches, highlighting the branch you are currently on.
```
git branch
```
Make a new branch.
```
git branch <branchname>
```
Change to a branch.
```
git checkout <branchname>
```
Make a new branch and change to it in one command.
```
git checkout -b <branchname>
```

##### Changes
Show all changes in the entire repository.
```
git diff
```
Show changes to a file.
```
git diff <file>
```
Show changes to a staged file (a file you already used 'git add' on).
```
git diff --cached <file>
```

## Troubleshooting
### Git tries to sync to the wrong address, due to outdated settings
[Update your settings with this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/).

### Git ignores upper/lower case changes in file names
```
ignorecase = false
```
